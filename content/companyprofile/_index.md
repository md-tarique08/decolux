Firstly it gives us immense pleasure to introduce ourselves on behalf of DECOLUX LIGHTING Our Company, DECOLUX LIGHTING, operating from the NEW TOWN RAJARHAT KOLKATA India, has developed and is manufacturing a range of LED Lights for exterior and interior applications. The exterior applications are for street lighting, perimeter lighting, and architectural lighting for buildings. The interior applications are for office buildings, corridors, shopping malls & industrial shop floors.

As you are well aware that LED Lights are the most advanced form of lighting and are now rapidly replacing all other forms of lighting, including Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFL) in the US and Europe. The major advantages of LED Lights over every other form of conventional lighting are outlined below:

-     Energy saving of over 50% compared to conventional lights
-     Long life of 100,000 hours (over 10 years usage) without any maintenance or replacement
-     High brilliance lighting with no harmful infrared or ultraviolet spectrum
      Monochromatic waveform closest to daylight with true colour rendition
- Very low heat generation in use

Large projects which have a high-energy consumption pattern can apply for carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol by the bulk use of LED Lights. 
Please find attached our product-catalogue your kind consideration. 

DECOLUX factory at the RAJARHAT, has installed streetlights and indoor lights, which can be visited to witness the advantages, and we can prove the economic benefits through energy savings in our premises.
